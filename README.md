## Programs

### Arithmetic.java
A program demonstrating basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is useful for understanding how to perform fundamental mathematical operations in Java.

### Calculator.java
A simple calculator program that takes user input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It showcases basic input handling and conditional logic in Java.

### Check 32or64_bit_JVM.java
A program to check if the JVM is running in 32-bit or 64-bit mode. This is useful for understanding system properties and ensuring compatibility of applications across different environments.

### Collection API.java
Examples and usage of Java's Collection API, including `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, and other collection classes. This program helps in understanding how to use collections for storing and manipulating groups of objects.

### Concepts_Explanation.java
Explanation and examples of various Java concepts such as OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation), data types, loops, and more. This serves as a comprehensive guide for beginners to understand core Java concepts.

### Eg_exception.java
A program illustrating exception handling in Java, including `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and custom exceptions. This helps in learning how to manage errors and ensure the robustness of Java applications.

### Eg_race_condition.java
A program demonstrating race conditions in multi-threaded applications and how to avoid them using synchronization. This is important for understanding concurrency and ensuring thread-safe operations in Java.

### Eg_thread_priority.java
A program showing how to set and manage thread priorities in Java. This is useful for understanding thread scheduling and how to influence the execution order of threads.

### InetAddressExample1.java
An example of using the `InetAddress` class to get IP addresses and host names. This program is helpful for learning about networking in Java and how to interact with IP addresses and domain names.

### Input Stream.java
Demonstrates the use of Input Streams in Java for reading data from various sources like files and network connections. This is crucial for understanding I/O operations in Java.

### Main.java
Main entry point for running various programs. This file typically contains the `main` method that initiates the execution of the program.

### Mem_manage.java
Examples of memory management in Java, including garbage collection, memory allocation, and optimization techniques. This helps in understanding how Java handles memory and how to write efficient Java programs.

### PSG_RAE.java
Program illustrating specific Java concepts, potentially related to advanced topics or custom implementations (needs detailed explanation). This could cover a range of advanced topics depending on the specific implementation.

### Patterns.java
Examples of design patterns in Java such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and others. This is useful for learning best practices in software design and how to implement common design patterns in Java.

### Serialization_demo.java
A program demonstrating serialization and deserialization in Java, showing how to convert objects to byte streams and vice versa. This is important for saving the state of objects and transferring them over networks.

### Stream_Demo.java
Examples of using Java streams for data processing, including filtering, mapping, and collecting data. This helps in understanding the powerful Stream API introduced in Java 8 for functional-style operations on collections.

### Test.java
A test program for various Java functionalities, potentially including unit tests and demonstrations of different features. This is useful for validating the correctness of code and practicing test-driven development.

### clientSide.java
Client-side code for network communication, typically involving socket programming. This program helps in understanding how to create networked applications and communicate with servers.

### game.java
A simple game implementation in Java, showcasing graphics, user input handling, and game logic. This is useful for learning about game development concepts and graphical programming in Java.

### serverSide.java
Server-side code for network communication, typically involving socket programming and handling multiple client connections. This program helps in understanding how to build server applications that can manage and respond to client requests.
